    <h1>Why GreenSteps?</h1>
    <p>Climate change is not a distant threat—it is a present-day reality impacting lives across the globe. 🌎</p>
    <p>Glaciers are melting, forests are vanishing, and clean water is becoming scarce. ❄️🌳🚱</p>
    <p>Wildlife habitats are shrinking, and millions are at risk due to rising sea levels and heatwaves. 🐘🌊🔥</p>
    <p>The future of our planet depends on the choices we make today. 🕒🌿</p>
    <p>Let’s act now to restore balance, preserve biodiversity, and protect Earth for future generations. ✨🌍💚</p>
